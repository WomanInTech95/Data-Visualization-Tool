Data Visualization with Python

Overview

This project demonstrates data visualization techniques using Python libraries matplotlib and seaborn. The script creates various types of plots to visualize a sample dataset, providing insights into data distributions, trends, and relationships.

Features

Visualize average values by category using a bar plot.
Display value trends over time using a line plot.
Show the distribution of values with a histogram.
Compare value distributions across categories using a box plot.
Explore relationships between variables with a scatter plot.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
Installation

Clone or Download the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Run the Script: Save the code provided in data_visualization.py, then execute:
bash
Copy code
python data_visualization.py
Usage

The script creates the following visualizations:

Bar Plot: Shows the average value by category.
Line Plot: Displays the value trend over time.
Histogram: Illustrates the distribution of values with a KDE overlay.
Box Plot: Compares the distribution of values across different categories.
Scatter Plot: Visualizes values over time, colored by category.
Each plot will be displayed in a separate window.

Example Output

When you run the script, you will see various visualizations that provide insights into the sample dataset, including:

A bar plot of average values by category.
A line plot showing how values change over time.
A histogram depicting the distribution of values.
A box plot comparing values across categories.
A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between values and time.
Enhancements

You can enhance this project by:

Modifying the sample dataset to analyze your own data.
Experimenting with different visualization types and styles.
Adding interactivity using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh.
